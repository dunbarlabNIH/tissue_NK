# Tissue_NK
Clonal tracking of Tissue-Resident Immune Cells

Scripts used to generate all figures are located in `/Scripts`. For example, scripts used to analyze the T cell clonal patterns for JM82 are located in `/Scripts/Figure2/JM82`.
`/Data` folder contains all data needed to make figures. 
      1. The clonal barcoded counts and the associated metadata files for each monkey is located in `/Data/counts_data`. 
      2. The cell numbers for each sample analyzed is in `/Data/cell_numbers`.
      3. The list of the samples analyzed for each figure is in `/Data/sample_lists`.
